Modelling Project
This project gives the possibility to use the knowledge acquired from the Modellbygge och Simulering course and put into practice together with programming skills. In this project students work in small groups. Each group is asked to make an animation of a physical system. This implies to determine the mathematical model first and then simulate the system on the basis of the model and represent a graphical animation of the system itself. Each group is free to choose the system to work on and also how to implement the model and the graphical animation. The work of each group is described in a written report. An oral presentation takes place at the end of the project where each group will present their own results.

The course consists of 6 points (hp).
